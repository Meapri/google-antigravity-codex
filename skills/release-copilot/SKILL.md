# Release Copilot

Use this skill when the requested deliverable is a release artifact or release
workflow.

## When To Use

Use Release Copilot for:

- PR descriptions and reviewer notes from local git changes
- release notes and changelog entries
- version and tag planning
- conventional commit classification
- recommended semantic version bumps
- GitHub compare URLs
- release readiness snapshots
- test or validation summaries for release artifacts

Do not use it for general implementation, debugging, refactoring strategy, or
architecture judgment unless the requested output is a release artifact.

## Tool Preference

Use `google_antigravity_release_snapshot` when Codex needs structured local git
release context.

Use `google_antigravity_release_draft` when the user wants a PR body, release
notes, changelog entry, or release summary. Keep `polish` false for deterministic
drafting; set `polish` true only when the user wants public prose polished
through Antigravity.

Use `google_antigravity_route_model` before polished release prose when the user
asks for model choice or when a capacity fallback would be useful.

Example:

```json
{
  "repo": ".",
  "check_commands": ["git diff --check"],
  "polish": true
}
```

## Safety

This integrated skill drafts release artifacts only. It does not create tags,
push tags, or publish GitHub releases. Codex may run those commands only after
explicit user approval and after verifying the working tree, tag name, release
notes, and authentication state.
